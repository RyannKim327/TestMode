They can be combined to create more complex circuits that perform a wide range of functions."

The pasta was amazing, but honestly, it was just so nice to spend time with you. I love how we can talk about anything and everything. Do you have any plans for the weekend? Maybe we could try that new coffee shop you mentioned!\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want me to say something specific!"

They perform logical operations on one or more binary inputs to produce a single binary output. Here are some common types of logic gates:\n\n1. **AND Gate**: Outputs true (1) only if all inputs are true. \n   - **Symbol**: A flat-ended shape with two or more inputs and one output.\n   - **Truth Table**:\n     - Input: 0, 0 → Output: 0\n     - Input: 0, 1 → Output: 0\n     - Input: 1, 0 → Output: 0\n     - Input: 1, 1 → Output: 1\n\n2. **OR Gate**: Outputs true if at least one input is true.\n   - **Symbol**: A curved shape with two or more inputs and one output.\n   - **Truth Table**:\n     - Input: 0, 0 → Output: 0\n     - Input: 0, 1 → Output: 1\n     - Input: 1, 0 → Output: 1\n     - Input: 1, 1 → Output: 1\n\n3. **NOT Gate**: Outputs the opposite of the input.\n   - **Symbol**: A triangle pointing to a small circle (indicating inversion).\n   - **Truth Table**:\n     - Input: 0 → Output: 1\n     - Input: 1 → Output: 0\n\n4. **NAND Gate**: Outputs false only if all inputs are true (NOT AND).\n   - **Symbol**: Similar to AND but with a small circle at the output.\n   - **Truth Table**:\n     - Input: 0, 0 → Output: 1\n     - Input: 0, 1 → Output: 1\n     - Input: 1, 0 → Output: 1\n     - Input: 1, 1 → Output: 0\n\n5. **NOR Gate**: Outputs true only if all inputs are false (NOT OR).\n   - **Symbol**: Similar to OR but with a small circle at the output.\n   - **Truth Table**:\n     - Input: 0, 0 → Output: 1\n     - Input: 0, 1 → Output: 0\n     - Input: 1, 0 → Output: 0\n     - Input: 1, 1 → Output: 0\n\n6. **XOR Gate**: Outputs true if the number of true inputs is odd.\n   - **Symbol**: Similar to OR but with an extra curved line.\n   - **Truth Table**:\n     - Input: 0, 0 → Output: 0\n     - Input: 0, 1 → Output: 1\n     - Input: 1, 0 → Output: 1\n     - Input: 1, 1 → Output: 0\n\n7. **XNOR Gate**: Outputs true if the number of true inputs is even (NOT XOR).\n   - **Symbol**: Similar to XOR but with a small circle at the output.\n   - **Truth Table**:\n     - Input: 0, 0 → Output: 1\n     - Input: 0, 1 → Output: 0\n     - Input: 1, 0 → Output: 0\n     - Input: 1, 1 → Output: 1\n\nThese gates are used in various combinations to create complex logic circuits used in computers, calculators, and other digital devices.
